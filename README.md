This repository contains the **erfars** Rust crate, which provides safe Rust bindings to the Essential Routines for Fundamental Astronomy ([ERFA](https://github.com/liberfa/erfa)) C library, which is based on the Standards of Fundamental Astronomy ([SOFA](https://www.iausofa.org/index.html)) library published by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

*Please note this library is currently a work in progress. Most, but not all of the [raw C bindings](./src/raw.rs) have safe equivalents.*
